 * @brief Defines the CommsController for handling network and serial communications.
 *
 * @details This class abstracts the underlying communication hardware (Ethernet and USB Serial)
 * and provides a simple, queue-based interface for sending and receiving messages. It is
 * responsible for device discovery, packetizing data, and parsing incoming commands.
 * This ensures that the main application logic remains decoupled from the specifics
 * of the communication protocols.
